abstract: >
  The space of probability distributions with finite second moments can be made
  into a natural metric space, called the Wasserstein space, whose metric is
  defined by using the optimal transportation between probability distributions.
  On this metric space one can draw curves that represent motion along the
  steepest descent (AKA gradient flow) of functionals of probability measures.
  This is a very fruitful way to view many important families of probability
  measures that arise from PDEs and stochastic processes. For example, using
  this geometric framework, one may derive functional inequalities and infer
  rates of convergence of Markov processes. A striking example is that of the
  heat equation, whose solution can be interpreted as the family of marginal
  distributions of Brownian motion. In the Wasserstein space, this curve of
  probability laws is the gradient flow of the Shannon entropy.

  
  We will discuss the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows, including the formal
  Riemannian calculus due to Otto, and the modern techniques of metric measures
  spaces. Apart from the classical examples, we will also discuss many modern
  variations such as Wasserstein mirror gradient flows that come up in
  statistical applications. A fruitful interaction between probability,
  geometry, and PDE theory will be developed simultaneously.

  This is a continuation of the sequence of OT+X courses under the Kantorovich
  Initiative.

## Delivery Details

The course is being offered simultaneously at Korea Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology (KAIST) and the PIMS network, including the University of
Washington, Seattle. **Due to different time schedules for individual campuses
and
the time zones, the course has an unusual structure. Please read the details
below carefully.**

### Lectures
* Lecture hours **6:30pm - 8pm Pacific on Tuesdays and Thursdays**. Thus we will
have two classes per week, each for 90 mins.

* Lectures will be taught over Zoom and videos and notes will be made available
  to everyone afterwards.

* A Slack channel will be used to communicate with students and distribute
  teaching material.

  There will be no exams in this course. Occasional homework problems will be
  provided.

### Registration
Students at Canadian PIMS Member Universities may register through the [Western
Deans Agreement](http://wcdgs.ca/western-deans-agreement.html). Students at UW
may register directly for the UW course. Course codes and other registration
details for students in either of these cases are listed in the registration
section above. Students at other institutions should contact one of the
instructors to attend the course as a
non-registered student.

## Course Structure

### Part I
Part I is a recap of the basics of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport theory.
_You do NOT need to take this part if you are already familiar with the basics_.
This will be covered between **AUG 28** and **SEP 26**. Topics covered during
this period are:

* linear programming
* Monge-Kantorovich problem
* Kantorovich duality
* Monge-Ampère PDE
* Brenier’s Theorem
* Wasserstein-2 metric

### Part II
This will start on **SEP 27** and continue through **DEC 7**. A rough syllabus
of topics covered are presented below in the order they will be covered. There
might be some changes depending on our progress.


#### core topics
* Wasserstein space
  * metric property
  * geodesics, displacement interpolation, generalized geodesic
  * Geodesic convexity
* AC curves in the Waserstein space and the continuity equation
* Benamou-Brenier and dynamic OT
* Otto calculus
  * tangent spaces to the Wasserstein space
  * Riemannian gradient
* Diffusions as gradient flows via Otto calculus
  * Brownian motion
  * Langevin diffusions

#### Modern research topics that will be surveyed
* log-Sobolev and other functional inequalities
* Convergence of finite dimensional gradient flow of particles to the
  **McKean-Vlasov diffusions** and gradient flow in the Wasserstein space.
* The implicit Euler or JKO scheme
