abstract: >
  This will be a standard graduate number theory course. Topics will include:
    * Number fields, rings of integers, ideals and unique factorization. Finiteness of the class group.
    * Valuations and completions; local fields.
    * Ramification theory, the different and discriminant.
    * Geometry of numbers: Dirichlet's Unit Theorem. and discriminant bounds.
    * Other topics if time permits

  The main pre-requisites are basic algebra (rings and fields, rings of
  polynomials, unique factorization in Euclidean\ndomains), basic number theory
  (modular arithemtic, factorization into primes) and Galois Theory, but no
  specific courses are required.
