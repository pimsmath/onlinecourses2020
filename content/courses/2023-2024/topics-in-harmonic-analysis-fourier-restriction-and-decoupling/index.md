prerequisites: 
  - This course assumes graduate-level background in measure theory, real

abstract: >
  We will cover the advances in decoupling theory beginning with Bourgain and
  Demeter's 2014 proof of the $l^2$ decoupling conjecture. We will also cover
  Fourier restriction theory, and in particular the recent use of tools such as
  the polynomial method.
