abstract: |
  The course will provide an introduction to algebraic and probabilistic
  techniques in combinatorics and graph theory. The main topics included will
  be: Eigenvalues of graphs and their applications, probabilistic methods (first
  order, second order, Lovasz local lemma), Szemeredi regularity lemma. Recent
  discoveries like the proof of the Sensitivity conjecture, the use of
  eigenvalues for equiangular lines, etc., will be part of the course. '
