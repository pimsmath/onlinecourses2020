- A graduate course in analytic number theory that includes Dirichlet series and
  a complex-analytic proof of the prime number theorem (preferably Analytic
  Number Theory I taught by Kadiri in Fall 2022)
abstract: >
  This course is an advanced graduate course in number theory, designed to
  follow [Analytic Number Theory I](/courses/2022-2023/analytic-number-theory-i)
  taught by Prof. Habiba Kadiri (University of Lethbridge) in Fall 2022 and
  Analytic Number Theory II taught by Prof. Greg Martin (UBC) in Winter 2023.
  All three of these courses are part of the current PIMS CRG "L-functions in
  Analytic Number Theory". In this course, we will establish estimates for
  moments of L-functions and explore the tools needed to study them including
  approximate functional equations, zero density estimates, zero free regions,
  mean value estimates for Dirichlet polynomials, large sieve inequalities,
  Poisson and Voronoi summation formulae, shifted convolution sums, holomorphic
  modular forms and associated L-functions, trace formulae, and the spectral
  theory of automorphic forms.
