  In this course we will study the theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation
  laws.


  Hyperbolic systems arise in many areas of applied mathematics,
  including gas dynamics, thermodynamics, population dynamics, or traffic flow.
  In contrast to dissipative systems (like reaction-diffusion equations),
  solutions of hyperbolic systems with smooth initial data can generate
  "shocks" in finite time.  The solution is no longer differentiable and weak
  solutions have to be studied.


  We will develop the existence and uniqueness theory for solutions of
  conservation laws in spaces of functions of "bounded variation\" (BV-spaces).
  At the beginning we will recall distributions and weak limits of measures.
  Then we study "broad" solutions (solutions which do not form shocks). After
  that we investigate discontinuous solutions in detail, we will derive the
  Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, the entropy conditions, the Lax-condition and we
  will discuss the vanishing viscosity method. We will classify strictly
  hyperbolic systems into genuinely nonlinear or linear degenerate systems. Then
  we use solutions to the Riemann problem to define a front tracking algorithm.
  This method is merely an\ analytical tool to obtain results on local and
  global existence and on uniqueness.
