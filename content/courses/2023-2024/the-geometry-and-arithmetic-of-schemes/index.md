abstract: > 
  The objective of this course is to provide an introduction to modern algebraic
  geometry in the language of schemes, with an emphasis on arithmetic schemes,
  integral models and applications to L-functions, and resolutions of
  singularities. The course also introduces the etale site on varieties, and
  sheaves on this site.
