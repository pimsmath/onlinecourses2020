  Spectral methods are numerical methods for solving PDEs. When the solution is
  analytic, the convergence rate is exponential. The first part of this course
  gives an introduction to spectral methods. The emphasis is on the analysis of
  these methods including truncation and interpolation error estimates, and
  condition number estimates. The second part of the course focuses on fast
  algorithms for orthogonal polynomials. These algorithms leverage
  data-sparsities that are present in many of the problems when solved by
  orthogonal polynomial expansions.

    1. Trigonometric and orthogonal polynomials (truncation and interpolation
       error estimates, aliasing, Lebesgue constants)
    2. Fourier spectral (FFT), spectral Galerkin and spectral tau methods
    3. Spectral collocation for Poisson equation with Dirichlet BCs (convergence
       and condition number estimates)

  ####  Part II: Fast Algorithms for Orthogonal Polynomials (Mikael Slevinsky)


    1. Synthesis and analysis
    2. Chebyshev polynomials and the fast discrete sine and cosine transforms
    3. Modification algorithms for orthogonal polynomials (d) Fast approximation
       of the connection coefficients

##### Grading Scheme
There are 4 Homeworks (each contributing 17% toward the grade) and a project (32%).

##### Academic Integrity
The Department of Mathematics, the Faculty of Science and the University of
Manitoba regard acts of academic dishonesty in quizzes, tests, examinations or
assignments as serious offenses and may assess a variety of penalties depending
on the nature of the offense. Acts of academic dishonesty include bringing
unauthorized materials into a test or exam, copying from another student,
plagiarism and examination personation. Students are advised to read section 7
(Academic Integrity) and section 4.2.8 (Examinations: Personations) in the
"General Academic Regulations and Requirement" of the current Undergraduate
Calendar. Note, in particular that cell phones and pagers are explicitly
listed as unauthorized materials, and hence may not be present during tests or
examinations. Penalties for violation include being assigned a grade of zero on
a test or assignment, being assigned a grade of “F” in a course, compulsory
withdrawal from a course or program, suspension from a course/program/faculty or
even expulsion from the University. For specific details about the nature of
penalties that may be assessed upon conviction of an act of academic dishonesty,
students are referred to University Policy 1202 (Student Discipline Bylaw) and
to the Department of Mathematics policy concerning minimum penalties for acts of
academic dishonesty. The Student Discipline Bylaw is printed in its entirety in
the Student Guide, and is also available on-line or through the Office of the
University Secretary. Minimum penalties assessed by the Department of
Mathematics for acts of academic dishonesty are available on the Department of
Mathematics web-page. All Faculty members (and their teaching assistants) have
been instructed to be vigilant and report incidents of academic dishonesty to
the Head of the Department.
