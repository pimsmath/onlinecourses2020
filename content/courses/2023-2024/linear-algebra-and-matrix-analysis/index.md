prerequisites:
  - Permission of the department. The course is dual listed, the undergraduate
    version requires a second year linear algebra course. While the
    prerequisites are low, you should be comfortable with the content of a solid
    second year linear algebra course, as the course is fast paced.
   
abstract: >
  Matrices are ubiquitous in many aspects of mathematics. They show up, for
  instance, when considering the local asymptotic stability of equilibria of
  systems of ordinary differential equations, the long term behaviour of Markov
  chains, the study of graphs and the discretization of reaction-diffusion
  equations.

  ##### Objectives of the course:

    1. explore the role of matrices in several fields of mathematics;
    1. study properties of these matrices;
    1. develop a toolbox to study some matrix properties computationally.
