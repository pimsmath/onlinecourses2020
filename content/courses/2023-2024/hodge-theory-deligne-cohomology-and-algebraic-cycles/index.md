prerequisites:
  - Students should have taken a course on algebraic geometry. It is helpful to
    know some differential geometry, particularly how it applies to complex
    manifolds, de Rham and Betti (singular) cohomology. Some exposure to
    homological algebra will be useful.
abstract: >
  Students taking this course will be exposed to the latest developments in the
  field of regulators algebraic cycles. This course was taught to advanced
  graduate students and experts alike at the University of Alberta in 2013. It
  was later taught at the University of Science and Technology in China, in
  2014. A *detailed* syllabus can be extracted from the table of contents of the
  uploaded pdf file.
