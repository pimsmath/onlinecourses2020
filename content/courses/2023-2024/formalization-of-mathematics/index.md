prerequisites: 
  - There are no strict mathematical prerequisites, but a certain level of
    mathematical maturity will be assumed (see the syllabus for more details).
    Although not strictly required, it would be useful for students to have some
    *minor* level of familiarity with interactive theorem proving, for example
    at the level of the [natural number
    game](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/)
abstract: >
  The last few years have seen amazing advances in interactive proof assistants
  and their use in mathematics. For example, Lean's mathematics library
  `mathlib` now has over one million lines of code and is still growing in a
  significant rate.  Furthermore, recent highly celebrated successes in the
  subject, such as the completion of the *sphere eversion project* and the
  *liquid tensor experiment*, suggest that we are approaching a paradigm shift
  in mathematics, where cutting edge research can be formally verified in a
  relatively short amount of time. This course will serve as an introduction to
  the formalization of mathematics, using the Lean4 interactive proof assistant
  and its mathematics library `Mathlib4`. See the attached syllabus for an
  outline of the topics we expect to cover.
