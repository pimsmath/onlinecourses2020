abstract: >
  Ergodic theory is the study of measure-preserving transformations. These occur
  naturally in an array of areas of mathematics (e.g. probability, number
  theory, geometry, information theory). The course will introduce
  measure-preserving transformations, give a range of basic examples, prove a
  number of general theorems (including the Poincare recurrence theorem, the
  Birkhoff ergodic theorem and sub-additive ergodic theorem). Entropy, one of
  the principal invariants of ergodic theory will be introduced.  From there,
  the course will focus on applications to other areas.
