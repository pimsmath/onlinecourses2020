abstract: >
  The modern theory of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport is barely three decades
  old. Already it has established itself as one of the most happening areas in
  mathematics. It lies at the intersection of analysis, geometry, and probability
  with numerous applications to physics, economics, and serious machine learning.
  This two quarter long graduate topics course will serve as an introduction to
  this rich and useful theory. 
  
  We will roughly follow the following outline.
  
  Fall: Classical theory. Analytic description of solutions. Duality. Displacement
  convexity. The geometry of the Wasserstein space and Otto calculus. 
 
  Winter: Entropy-regularized OT. Schroedinger bridges and statistical OT. 
  This is a continuation of the sequence of OT+X courses under the Kantorovich
  Initiative.

## Delivery Details

### Registration
Students at Canadian PIMS Member Universities may register through the [Western
Deans Agreement](http://wcdgs.ca/western-deans-agreement.html). Students at UW
may register directly for the UW course. Course codes and other registration
details for students in either of these cases are listed in the registration
section above. Students at other institutions should contact one of the
instructors to attend the course as a
non-registered student.


### Remote Participation
Online instructions over Zoom. Written on a tablet. Notes will be provided. A
Slack channel will be created for answering student questions. Weekly in person
office hours will be held at UW and UBC.

Lecture notes will be distributed over Slack. Recorded lectures may be viewed on
our YouTube channel.
