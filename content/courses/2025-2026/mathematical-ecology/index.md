  In this course we are learning to build and analyse nonlinear partial
  differential equation models. The focus of the course will be models of
  ecological systems, but the techniques learned apply broadly across
  application areas.  We learn a wide variety of analytic, graphic, and
  simplification techniques which elucidate the behaviour of these mathematical
  models, whether or not a closed-form solution is available. By the end of the
  class, the students will be able to competently read and follow a research
  paper presenting and analysing a differential equation model from a wide
  variety of application areas.

  Broadly, the topics that we cover are applications of ecological applications
  of travelling waves, disease models, and pattern formation in
  reaction-diffusion and reaction-diffusion-chemotaxis models.
