prerequisites:
  - a first course in real analysis, and some point-set topology, including
    quotient topologies, connectedness, path-connectedness.
  - Homotopy of maps and homotopy equivalence of spaces will be assumed, but
    the necessary background here can be quickly covered by self-study.
  - Fundamental groups and covering spaces, while helpful, are not necessary.
  - the theory of abelian groups, isomorphism theorems and the classification
    of finitely generated abelian groups.
  - Ring theory and the theory of modules over commutative rings is extremely
    helpful, but not formally required.

abstract: >
  This is a course in homology and cohomology of topological spaces. We study
  spaces and continuous functions by means of abelian groups and their
  homomorphisms. Topics will include cellular homology of spaces, calculation
  techniques and applications (e.g., fixed point theorems, invariance of
  domain), homological algebra, and cohomology, including the cup product and
  Poincar√© duality.
