course_number: MATH 527
section_number: ''
section_code: '201'
prerequisites:
  - a first course in real analysis, and some point-set topology, including
    quotient topologies, connectedness, path-connectedness.
  - Homotopy of maps and homotopy equivalence of spaces will be assumed, but
    the necessary background here can be quickly covered by self-study.
  - Fundamental groups and covering spaces, while helpful, are not necessary.
  - the theory of abelian groups, isomorphism theorems and the classification
    of finitely generated abelian groups.
  - Ring theory and the theory of modules over commutative rings is extremely
    helpful, but not formally required.

abstract: >
  This is a course in homology and cohomology of topological spaces. We study
  spaces and continuous functions by means of abelian groups and their
  homomorphisms. Topics will include cellular homology of spaces, calculation
  techniques and applications (e.g., fixed point theorems, invariance of
  domain), homological algebra, and cohomology, including the cup product and
  Poincaré duality.

### Remote Access
Remote access for this course will be provided via zoom. The instructor intends
to lecture from handwritten notes on a tablet. Lecture notes will be provided
after the lectures have been delivered.

### Availability
This course may be open to students from universities outside of the PIMS network, and those
coming from industry/government.

### Assessment
Assessment will be via homework, midterm and final exam.


### Provisional Syllabus for Math 427/527
_N.B. The syllabus is also available as a [pdf
document](/courses/2025-2026/algebraic-topology/SyllabusM427527.pdf)._

####  Topics in Topology/Algebraic Topology I

##### Land acknowledgement
UBC Vancouver is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of
the Musqueam people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of
learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their
culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.

##### General information
 * **Term:** Second winter term, 2025--2026.
 * **Meeting time:** TuTh 9:30am--10:50am.
 * **Location:** Math 426 is listed as an in-person course, while Math 527 is
   listed as a hybrid course. Lectures will be held in ESB 4133 (the PIMS
   library) and will be streamed over Zoom. In person attendance is encouraged
   for UBC students.
 * **Instructor**: Ben Williams
   * **email:** tbjw@math.ubc.ca
   * **office:** MATX 1205.

##### Prerequisites
_You must be able to work with abelian groups_. This prerequisite can be
sometimes overlooked. Beyond this, the course is actually two, crosslisted
courses.
 * **For Math 427:** The prerequisite for Math 427 (the undergraduate course) is Math
   426.
 * **For Math 527:** Here is an attempt to list the background you need to have
   to get the most out of Math 527 as a graduate student. The list may not be
   exhaustive, but if you are familiar with almost all the topics on this list,
   you should be fine.
    * **Point-set topology:** Open and closed sets, continuous functions,
      product topologies, quotient topologies, compactness, path-connectedness
      and connectedness.
    * **Basic homotopy theory:** the definition of homotopy, contractibility,
      deformation retracts, homotopy equivalences.
    * **Algebra:** groups and especially abelian groups, the structure theory of
      finitely generated abelian groups, the isomorphism theorems. Finite
      dimensional linear algebra.

There are some topics that will be helpful to know about, but should not be
strictly necessary for the development of the theory.
  * Fundamental groups.
  * Covering spaces.
  * Modules over commutative rings.

If you are a graduate student who wants to take this course, but are concerned
you may lack some prerequisite, please contact me directly.

##### Textbooks and notes

###### Primary text
The course will follow [[https://doi.org/10.1142/12132][Lectures on Algebraic
Topology]] by Haynes Miller. This book is a bound version of the notes that are
available [[https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/lectures-905-906.pdf][online]]. We
will follow the notation and terminology of this book for the most part. The
course may also refer to the exercises from
[[https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html][Algebraic Topology]] by
Alan Hatcher, which is freely available online.

- [Algebraic Topology](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html) by
  Alan Hatcher. This book may suit people who like thinking about
  low-dimensional examples a lot. It is somewhat less algebraic in tone than the
  other texts. It covers a large amount of material.

##### Assessment and grade

###### Homework
There will be fortnightly homework, of which your lowest-scoring assignment will
be dropped. Homework will constitute 15% of the overall grade.

Grading of homework will be based on correctness, completeness and readability.
That is, points may be taken off for answers that are confusing, poorly
presented, poorly explained, or devote a great deal of attention to irrelevant
points.

You are encouraged to work with each other on the homework assignments, but the
work you turn in must be your own. The use of AI tools for anything other than
checking spelling, grammar and LaTeX formatting is prohibited.

###### Midterm
There is an in-class midterm, worth 20% of the grade. This will be held at a
time to be settled later.

###### Final
The final is worth the rest of the grade, 65%. The time of final will be set by
UBC scheduling during the term.

##### Concession policy
  * For homework, the first concession is that we drop the lowest-scoring
    assignment for all students. Further concessions can be discussed with the
    instructor if they become necessary.
  * Students doing better on the final than on the midterm (including cases
    where the midterm was not written) will have their final count for 85% of
    the course grade, replacing the midterm.

##### Content
The course covers the first three chapters of
[Miller's book](https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/lectures-905-906.pdf).

The following is an approximate weekly schedule of the course.
 1. Chains and homology. Categories, functors and natural transformations.
 2. Homotopy, invariance of homology.
 3. Relative homology and the long exact sequence.
 4. Excision. The Eilenberg--Steenrod axioms. Subdivision.
 5. CW Complexes and their homology.
 6. Examples. Homology with coefficients.
 7. Tensor products, Tor
 8. Universal coefficients. The Künneth formula.
 9. Cohomology. The universal coefficient theorem.
 10. Products and coproducts. Local coefficients. Orientations.
 11. Cap product. Čech cohomology.
 12. Poincaré duality and applications.

##### University policies and resources
UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy
lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are
additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual assault.
UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic
community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of
academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with
disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values
academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by
others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.

Details of the policies and how to access support are available on the [UBC
Senate
website](https://senate.ubc.ca/vancouver/policies-resources-support-student-success/).
