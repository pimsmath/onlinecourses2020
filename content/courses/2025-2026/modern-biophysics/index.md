abstract: >
  This graduate course is designed to provide graduate students with key
  concepts and practical applications in Biophysics, with an emphasis on the
  quantitative tools as they are used in current research. Biophysics is a
  highly interdisciplinary field—the researchers who attend the annual
  Biophysical Society meeting, for example, come from departments spanning all
  of the STEM disciplines. Nevertheless, they share a common interest to
  establish a quantitative understanding of living matter. Despite growing
  interest however, a gap remains in graduate training to prepare students to
  contribute effectively to this broad and rapidly evolving field.

  This course aims to address this gap by covering both foundational and
  advanced concepts and applications that are commonly used by practicing
  biophysicists today. The structure of the course will follow selected advanced
  material from Physical Biology of the Cell by Rob Phillips, Jane Kondev, Julie
  Theriot, and Hernan G. Garcia. Each topic will be introduced conceptually,
  developed mathematically, and explored through real biological case studies
  using both textbook material and current literature. Given student interest,
  the course may include interviews with leading biophysicists on their recent
  published work.

  Topics will include:
    * Diffusion problems in biology
    * Enzymatic reactions including ODEs, diffusion-limited reactions, and
      Michaelis-Menton reactions
    * Statistical mechanics as it applies to Biology, including Gibbs free energy
      of biochemical reactions
    * Liquid-liquid phase separation, and its role in the cell and in
      transcription
    * Polymer physics; DNA looping, persistence length, polymer entropy
    * Heterogeneous mixtures and osmotic pressure
    * Quantitative analysis of genetic networks
    * Expression distributions of transcription and translation
    * Phase portrait analysis and stability/metastability of cellular states
    * Genetics of enhancers – from a biophysical perspective
    * Pattern formation including Turing patterns, symmetry breaking in an embryo
    * Quantitative genomics (time permitting)

### Class Schedule
  * TBA

### Remote Access
Remote participation will be via zoom. Lectures will also be recorded and shared
via UBC's media capture system Panopto. Annotated notes on pre-distributed PDF
slides are made during class using an iPad, recorded in real time, and uploaded
to UBC's Canvas server after class, along with links to the lecture recording.

### Availability
This course may be open to students at universities outside of the PIMS network.
