abstract: >
  This graduate course is designed to provide graduate students with key
  concepts and practical applications in Biophysics, with an emphasis on the
  quantitative tools as they are used in current research. Biophysics is a
  highly interdisciplinary field—the researchers who attend the annual
  Biophysical Society meeting, for example, come from departments spanning all
  of the STEM disciplines. Nevertheless, they share a common interest to
  establish a quantitative understanding of living matter. Despite growing
  interest however, a gap remains in graduate training to prepare students to
  contribute effectively to this broad and rapidly evolving field.

  This course aims to address this gap by covering both foundational and
  advanced concepts and applications that are commonly used by practicing
  biophysicists today. The structure of the course will follow selected advanced
  material from Physical Biology of the Cell by Rob Phillips, Jane Kondev, Julie
  Theriot, and Hernan G. Garcia. Each topic will be introduced conceptually,
  developed mathematically, and explored through real biological case studies
  using both textbook material and current literature. Given student interest,
  the course may include interviews with leading biophysicists on their recent
  published work.

  Topics will include:
    * Diffusion problems in biology
    * Enzymatic reactions including ODEs, diffusion-limited reactions, and
      Michaelis-Menton reactions
    * Statistical mechanics as it applies to Biology, including Gibbs free energy
      of biochemical reactions
    * Liquid-liquid phase separation, and its role in the cell and in
      transcription
    * Polymer physics; DNA looping, persistence length, polymer entropy
    * Heterogeneous mixtures and osmotic pressure
    * Quantitative analysis of genetic networks
    * Expression distributions of transcription and translation
    * Phase portrait analysis and stability/metastability of cellular states
    * Genetics of enhancers – from a biophysical perspective
    * Pattern formation including Turing patterns, symmetry breaking in an embryo
    * Quantitative genomics (time permitting)

### Class Schedule
  * Wed, Fri 10am-11:30am (classes will begin Sept. 10)

### Remote Access
Remote participation will be via zoom. Lectures will also be recorded and shared
via UBC's media capture system Panopto. Annotated notes on pre-distributed PDF
slides are made during class using an iPad, recorded in real time, and uploaded
to UBC's Canvas server after class, along with links to the lecture recording.

### Availability
This course may be open to students at universities outside of the PIMS network.


### Grading
There will be no Final exam, instead there will be a final project. I've
tentatively planned for an in-class midterm, but as a directed studies class,
this may become a "take-home" midterm. For percentages, here is a tentative
breakdown:

#### Homework (45%)

_**Homework due each Sunday at 11:59 pm.**_

Homework is assigned a week prior to the due date. I will allow late homework,
however a 10% penalty per day after the due date is applied to late HW. There
will be ~11 homework assignments. Assignments are roughly the same length; The
points for each assignment will be weighted proportional to the number of
problems in it.

#### Midterm (20%)
_**The midterm will take place on evening of Nov 13 or Nov 14 at 6 pm.**_

The content cut-off for the material will be up and including the Friday before
midterm break (Nov 7) and the format will be discussed in class in advance.
Email me by Friday Sept 12 if you have a conflict (steve@phas.ubc.ca). The
in-class midterm may be replaced with a take-home midterm. |


#### Final Project (20%)

Date and time the final project is due will be announced, but it will be some
time during the Dec exam period. We will discuss how to best design these
projects to be most beneficial to everyone.

#### Guest speaker interviews and Lab Tutorial (15%)

I am thinking of including interviews of postdocs or professors, as I have done
in the past. If we do this, we will read an assigned publication by a guest
scientist or their lead first-author student/PDF, and we will then interview
that scientist/student on the paper. Both general and specific questions may be
asked during each interview. However, _technical questions specific to the paper
are essential for credit_. The number of interviews we have is TBD.

One of your planned assignments will also be to complete a lab tutorial
involving some more open-ended questions about experimental observations, which
will be described further in Module 7 of the course.


### Textbook
The textbook for Physics 305 is Physical Biology of the Cell (2nd edition), by
Rob Phillips, Jane Kondev, Julie Theriot, and Hernan Garcia. It is available
from multiple resources including Amazon as either a paperback or eTextbook.
Downloadable resources for the text are
[here](https://www.routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/9780815344506/downloadable_resources.php).
We will also use material from select journal sources.
