  The purpose of this graduate course is to equip graduate students with
  cutting-edge techniques in data-driven mathematical and computational
  modelling, analysis and simulations of semi-linear parabolic partial
  differential equations (PDEs) of reaction-diffusion type. It will cover diverse
  areas in data-driven modelling using PDEs in biology. I will cover approaches
  on formulating models from data using first principles, mathematical analysis
  of reaction-diffusion systems such as linear stability analysis, basic concepts
  on bifurcation analysis and numerical bifurcation analysis. The second part
  will focus on numerical methods for PDEs including finite difference methods,
  and finite elements. This part will also deal with time-stepping schemes and
  nonlinear solvers for nonlinear PDEs. If time allows, we will look at
  applications of reaction diffusion theory to cell motility and pattern
  formation. To support theoretical modelling and numerical analysis, numerical
  algorithms will be developed and implemented in MATLAB as well as in open
  finite element source software packages such as FeNiCs, deal.ii and others.
  Students will be allowed to use packages of their choice as appropriate.
