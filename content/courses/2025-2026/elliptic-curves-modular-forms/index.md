  This course is an introduction to the theory of elliptic curves and modular
  forms at the graduate level.

  Elliptic curves will be introduced through both their classical analytic
  construction over the real and complex numbers and their algebraic
  realizations via normal forms over arbitrary fields. Moduli and monodromy
  considerations lead us to study the special role of the elliptic modular group
  SL(2,Z) and the crucial notions of modular functions and forms. Studying
  torsion points and level structure then motivates the extension to finite
  index subgroups and the theory of modular curves. Throughout the course, there
  will be an emphasis on hands-on explicit computations.

  Directed by the instructor, each student will complete a final project,
  presentation, and paper. Possible topics could include post-quantum elliptic
  curve cryptography, applications in string theory, geometry of elliptic
  modular surfaces, features of periods and Picard-Fuchs operators, etc.

### Class Schedule
  * TBA

### Remote Access
The course will be taught over Zoom using a tablet and shared screen.  Lecture
notes will be written out live on a tablet. There will also be pre-prepared
slides on certain topics.  The in-class lecture notes will be saved and
distributed as .pdf files. There will be a course webpage to host all of these
plus additional course materials and readings.

The format will be Zoom based, with videos on. Breakout rooms will be used
periodically for small group work. Students will be encouraged to "raise hands"
with questions at any time.
