abstract: >
  Discrete optimization focuses on developing efficient methods to determine the
  maximum or minimum value of a function over a finite (discrete) domain. This
  course will cover a wide range of topics in discrete optimization which may
  include linear programming, semi-definite programming, dynamic programming,
  matroids, combinatorial algorithms, duality, hardness reductions, among
  others. We will also see many interesting applications of tools from Discrete
  Optimization to problems in combinatorics and other areas of mathematics and
  computer science.

### Class Schedule
  * TBA

### Remote Access
Remote access for this course will be provided via zoom. This course will be
taught from the UVic Multiaccess classroom HHB 110. The room is equipped with
multiple cameras in the ceiling which can capture two blackboard areas and TV
screens that can be used to show the Zoom gallery. A demonstration of this
system can be seen in the instructor's existing [Extremal Combinatorics Network
Wide Course
playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtxJg53s2o0MEvvdIxPKI1AXYLI1cH4A2&si=M6HDNRpTOr5PGCH0).
Notes and other course related material will be made available on the
instructor's website (see e.g. notes for [Extreemal
Combinatorics](https://extremalcombinatorics.com/notes/root-1-2-2.html)).
