abstract: >
  Discrete optimization focuses on developing efficient methods to determine the
  maximum or minimum value of a function over a finite (discrete) domain. This
  course will cover a wide range of topics in discrete optimization which may
  include linear programming, semi-definite programming, dynamic programming,
  matroids, combinatorial algorithms, duality, hardness reductions, among
  others. We will also see many interesting applications of tools from Discrete
  Optimization to problems in combinatorics and other areas of mathematics and
  computer science.

### Course Webpage
This course will have an accompanying webpage

  * https://extremalcombinatorics.com/optimization/

Materials related to the course, links and other updates will be posted to the
course webpage as the course proceeds.

### Class Schedule
  * Monday, Thursday 1:00-2:20pm (PT)

### Remote Access
Remote access for this course will be provided via zoom. This course will be
taught from the UVic Multiaccess classroom HHB 110. The room is equipped with
multiple cameras in the ceiling which can capture two blackboard areas and TV
screens that can be used to show the Zoom gallery. A demonstration of this
system can be seen in the instructor's existing [Extremal Combinatorics Network
Wide Course
playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtxJg53s2o0MEvvdIxPKI1AXYLI1cH4A2&si=M6HDNRpTOr5PGCH0).
Notes and other course related material will be made available on the
instructor's website (see e.g. notes for [Extreemal
Combinatorics](https://extremalcombinatorics.com/notes/root-1-2-2.html)).

Lectures will also be live-streamed on the instructors [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jonathannoel/streams) and also be available to
[view there](https://www.youtube.com/@jonathannoel) asynchronously.

### Availability
This course may be open to students from universities outside of the PIMS
network, and those coming from industry/government.
