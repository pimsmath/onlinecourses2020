abstract: >
  This course will introduce the major tools in stochastic analysis from an
  applied mathematics perspective. Topics to be covered include Markov chains
  (both discrete and continuous), Gaussian processes, Ito calculus, stochastic
  differential equations (SDEs), numerical algorithms for solving SDEs, forward
  and backward Kolmogorov equations and their applications. It will pay
  particular attention to the connection between stochastic processes and PDEs,
  as well as to physical principles and applications. The class will attempt to
  strike a balance between rigour and heuristic arguments: it will assume that
  students have seen a little analysis, particularly in the context of studying
  PDEs, but will generally avoid measure theory. The target audience is graduate
  students in applied mathematics or related fields, who wish to use these tools
  in their research for modelling or simulation. 

  The course will be divided roughly into two parts: the first part will focus
  on stochastic processes, particularly Markov chains, and the second part will
  focus on stochastic differential equations and their associated PDEs.
