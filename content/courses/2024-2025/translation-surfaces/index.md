  Translation surfaces and their moduli spaces have been the objects of
  extensive recent study and interest, with connections to widely varied fields
  including (but not limited to) geometry and topology; Teichmüller theory;
  low-dimensional dynamical systems; homogeneous dynamics and Diophantine
  approximation; and algebraic and complex geometry. This course will serve as
  an introduction to some of the big ideas in the field, centered on the ergodic
  properties of translation flows and counting problems for saddle connections,
  and associated renormalization techniques, without attempting to reach the
  full state of the art (an aim that is in any case impossible given the speed
  at which the field is evolving).

  We will start by introducing the important motivating example of the flat
  torus, exploring its geometry, and its associated dynamical and counting
  problems. The linear flow on the torus and its associated first return map, a
  rotation of a circle, are amongst the first dynamical systems ever studied.
  The counting of closed orbits is intricately tied to number theory. We
  discuss, as motivation, the moduli space of translation surfaces on a torus, a
  bundle over the well-known modular curve and the action of $GL^+(2,\mathbb R)$
  on this space of translation surfaces. Translation surfaces are higher-genus
  generalizations of flat tori. We will define translation surfaces from three
  perspectives (Euclidean geometry, complex analysis, and geometric structures),
  and show how some translation surfaces arise from unfolding billiards in
  rational polygons. We will give a short introduction to Teichmüller theory and
  its relation to the study of translation surfaces, and discuss the natural
  dynamical systems associated to translation surfaces, namely, linear flows and
  their first return maps, interval exchange transformations. We will explore
  their ergodicity and mixing properties, and will study an important example of
  a translation surface flow for which every orbit is dense but not every orbit
  is equidistributed with respect to Lebesgue measure, a phenomenon that does
  not occur in the case of linear flows on the torus. We will show how
  information about the recurrence properties of an orbit of a translation
  surface under the positive diagonal subgroup of $SL(2, \mathbb R)$ (the
  Teichmüller geodesic flow) can be used to get information about
  the ergodic properties of the associated linear flow on an individual
  translation surface. As another example of the strength of renormalization
  ideas, we will show how the ergodic properties of the $SL(2, \mathbb
  R)$-action can be used to obtain counting results for saddle connections and,
  subsequently. Finally we will discuss examples, characterizations, and
  properties of surfaces with large affine symmetry groups, known as lattice or
  Veech surfaces.
