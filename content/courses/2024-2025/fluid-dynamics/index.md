abstract: >
  The course will be an introduction to the behaviour of fluids (liquids and
  gases) from an applied math perspective, starting with an introduction to the
  Navier-Stokes equations and other PDEs used to model fluids. The emphasis will
  be on physically relevant properties of solutions that can be deduced
  mathematically. The course will have more mathematics than a typical physics
  or engineering fluids course, including basic functional analysis and
  variational methods, and it will have more physics than a pure PDE analysis
  course. Through detailed study of several fundamental model systems, we will
  see
  PDE examples of topics that may be more familiar in the context of ODE
  dynamical systems, such as linear stability, nonlinear stability, bifurcations
  and chaos. Undergraduate knowledge of PDEs and real analysis are assumed.
