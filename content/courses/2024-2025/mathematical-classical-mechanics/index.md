    #### Mathematics
      * Real analysis & linear algebra (e.g. UBC
        [MATH320](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~feldman/m320/m320outline.html), [MATH321](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~malabika/teaching/ubc/spring19/math321/index.html), [MATH223](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~anstee/math223/math223.html))

    #### Physics
      * Basic undergraduate mechnics (e.g. UBC
        [PHYS216](https://phas.ubc.ca/~rozali/phys216.html))

abstract: > 
  This course presents classical mechanics to a mixed audience of mathematics
  and physics undergraduate and graduate students. It is complementary to
  regular phsyics courses in that while the physics background will be developed
  the emphasis will be on the resulting mathematical analysis.

  Physics topics may include Newtonian mechanics and Galilean symmetry,
  Lagrangian mechanics, conservation laws and Noether's Theorem, rigid body
  motion, Hamiltonian mechanics. Mathematical topics may include existence
  and uniqueness of solutions to ODE, calculus of variations, convexity and
  Legendre transformations, manifolds, tangent and cotangent vectors,
  rotations and the orthogonal group.

  2. Newtonian mechanics; existence and uniqueness of solutions to ODE.
  Examples: simple harmonic motion; central potentials; 
  3. Symmetry and the Galilean group; change of coordinates
  4. Lagrangian mechanics; calculus of variations, Lagrange multipliers.
  5. Constraints and manifolds; the tangent bundle.
  6. Symmetry, rigid body motion and angular momentum; Noether's Theorem, the
     orthogonal group, and its Lie algebra
  7. Hamiltonian mechanics; convexity and Legendre transformation, the
     cotangent bundle.
  8. Conserved quantities and the Poisson bracket; symplectic structure

### Remote Access
Lectures will be held in-person on the UBC campus and on Zoom.  Lectures will be
recorded and the videos posted to an unlisted but openly accessible YouTube
playlist.  There will be Zoom office hours and a Piazza discussion board.
