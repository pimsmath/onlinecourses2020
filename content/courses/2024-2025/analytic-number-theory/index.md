  This course provides an introduction into analytic number theoretic methods
  with applications to arithmetic geometry. We will study Dirichlet series with
  applications to distributions of prime numbers and as examples of L-series. We
  will also look at modular forms and their applications to the arithmetic of
  elliptic curves and their moduli spaces.

  We will also consider results in diophantine approximation, such as lower
  bounds on linear combinations of logs of algebraic numbers, with as
  application Siegel's theorem on finiteness of integral points on elliptic
  curves.

The class will be held in a room equipped with controllable cameras. The
instructor will write on whiteboards in this room and the camera controls used
to provide clear views of the boards.
