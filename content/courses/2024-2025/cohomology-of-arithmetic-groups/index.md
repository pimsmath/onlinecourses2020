prerequisites:
 -  We will aim to make this course accessible to students with a basic
    background in algebra and analysis (at the level of introductory graduate
    courses) and basic topology (having seen cohomology before would be useful,
    but is not absolutely essential). Although no specific knowledge from
    differential geometry, Lie theory, or number theory are required, additional
    familiarity or interest in these fields will be useful, especially in the
    latter parts of the course.
abstract: > 
  The most basic example of an arithmetic group is $\Gamma=SL_n(Z),$ and
  understanding the cohomology of this group (and its close relatives) will be the
  basic theme of this course. The cohomology we are interested in can also be
  identified with that of the locally symmetric space $\Gamma \setminus X$ where,
  in this case, $X= SL_n(R)/ SO(n)$ is a generalization of the (complex) upper
  half plane. As such, a diverse set of techniques, stemming from geometry,
  topology, harmonic analysis, and number theory can be used to analyze the
  situation. After carefully developing the basics of the subject, we will present
  some of the major developments in this area (mostly from the 1960s-1970s), and
  then end with an overview of modern directions.
