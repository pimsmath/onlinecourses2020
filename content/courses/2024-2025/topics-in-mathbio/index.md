abstract: > 
  Advances in imaging techniques have enabled the access to 3D shapes present in
  a variety of biological structures: organs, cells, organelles, and proteins.
  Since biological shapes are related to physiological functions, biological
  studies are poised to leverage such data, asking a common statistical
  question: how can we build mathematical and statistical descriptions of
  biological morphologies and their variations? In this course, we will review
  recent attempts to use advanced mathematical concepts to formalize and study
  shape heterogeneity, covering a wide range of imaging methods and
  applications. The main mathematical focus will be on basics of image
  processing (segmentation, skeletonization, meshing), [Diffeomorphisms and
  metrics over shape
  space](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-12055-8), [optimal
  transport theory with application for image
  analysis](https://www.imagedatascience.com/transport/tutorials_isbi18.html), [manifold
  learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1063520318302215),
  with some other concepts covered in specific applications (e.g. quasiconformal
  mapping theory for shape representation, 3D reconstruction in Fourier space…).
  Students will be encourage to work in groups to present research papers and do
  a small project to pass the course. This course will also build on the recent
  [BIRS workshop](https://www.birs.ca/events/2023/5-day-workshops/23w5142 ),
  [Joint Mathematics Meetings](https://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2024/2300_program_ss97.html),
  and the upcoming SIAM workshops (LSI 2024, SIMODS 2024) on this topic, with
  some participants to these events invited to contribute to this course and
  present their research.

### Lecture Schedule

### Remote Access
Remote access will be via zoom. A combination of prepared slides and hand
written notes will be used. The hand written notes will be on a blackboard or
tablet depending on room availability. The lecturer will distribute lecture
notes online.
