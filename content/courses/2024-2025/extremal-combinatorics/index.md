prerequisites:
  - An undergraduate course on discrete mathematics, combinatorics or graph
    theory. It is recommended that students have taken at least two such
    courses.
abstract: > 
  This course covers classical problems and modern techniques in extremal
  combinatorics. The first part of the course is on extremal properties of
  families of sets: e.g.
    * What is the largest size of a collection of k-element subsets of a set of
      size n in which any two sets in the collection intersect?
    * What is the largest size of a collection of subsets of a set of size n in
    which no set is properly contained within another?

  Other topics may include VC dimension, Kneser's Conjecture, the Kruskal-Katona
  Theorem and the Littlewood Offord Problem. The rest of the course is on
  extremal graph theory: e.g.
    * What is the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on n vertices?
    * What is the minimum number of 6-cycles in a graph with n vertices and m
      edges?
    * What is the minimum size of an independent set in a triangle-free graph?
 
  Other topics may include the Szemer√©di Regularity Lemma, Shannon Capacity, the
  Entropy Method, the Container Method and Stability. The course webpage, which
  includes a link to a preliminary version of the course notes, can be [found
  here](http://extremalcombinatorics.com/).

### Lecture Schedule
This course will run Sept. 4th-Dec. 4th, 2024. Lectures will take place
every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday from 10:30am-11:20am (Pacific Time). See the
[UVic course catalog
entry](https://www.uvic.ca/BAN1P/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=202409&subj_in=MATH&crse_in=426&schd_in=) for more details.

### Remote Access
Lectures will be livestreamed via Zoom. The lecturer will write on chalkboards
which will be shared via Zoom. Recordings of the lectures will be available for
asynchronous viewing. Preliminary lecture notes are available on the [course
website](http://extremalcombinatorics.com/) and assignments will be distributed
electronically.
