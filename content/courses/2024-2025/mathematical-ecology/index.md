  In this course we are learning to build and analyse nonlinear differential
  equation models. The focus of the course will be models of ecological systems,
  but the techniques learned apply broadly across application areas.  We learn a
  wide variety of analytic, graphic, and simplification techniques which
  elucidate the behaviour of these mathematical models, whether or not a
  closed-form solution is avalable. By the end of the class, the students will
  be able to competently read and follow a research paper presenting and
  analysing a differential equation model ffrom a wide variety of application
  areas.
