abstract: > 
  In the past 25 years or so, the subject of "Arithmetic Statistics", beginning
  with the work of Bhargava's success in enumerating rings and fields of low
  degree and rank, and Bhargava and Shankar's proof of the boundedness of
  algebraic rank of elliptic curves, is an enormously exciting subject. We will
  give an introduction to the subject centred on the work of Bhargava and his
  coworkers.
