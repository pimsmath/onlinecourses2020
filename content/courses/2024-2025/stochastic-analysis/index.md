abstract: > 
  This is a one semester three credit hour course. We shall first briefly
  introduce some basic concepts and results on stochastic processes, in
  particular the Brownian motions. Then we will discuss stochastic integrals,
  Ito formula, the existence and uniqueness of stochastic differential
  equations, some fundamental properties of the solution. We will concern with
  the Markov property, Kolmogorov backward and forward equations, Feynman-Kac
  formula, Girsanov formula. We will also concern with the ergodic theory and
  other stability problems. We may also mention some results on numerical
  simulations, Malliavin calculus and so on.
