Please note: The Western Deans' Agreement provides an automatic tuition fee waiver
for visiting students.  Graduate students paying normal required tuition fees at
their home institution will not pay tuition fees to the host institution.
However, students will typically be required to pay other ancillary fees to
the host institution (as much as $270) or explicitly request exemptions (e.g.
Insurance or travel fees).


For help completing the Western Deans' agreement form, please contact the
graduate advisor at your institution.  For more information about the agreement,
please see the <a target="_blank"
