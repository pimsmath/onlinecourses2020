The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences is pleased to announce the
following network-wide graduate courses in mathematical sciences. These courses
are available online and provide access to experts from throughout the PIMS
network.

Students at Canadian PIMS member universities may apply for graduate
credit via the <a href="#wda">Western Deans' Agreement (WDA)</i></a>, but please be
advised, in some cases, students must enroll 6 weeks in advance of the term
start date, and will typically be required to pay ancillary fees to the
host institution (as much as $250) or explicitly request exemptions.  Please
see the <a href="#wda">WDA section</a> for details of fees at
specific sites, and check the individual courses below for registration
details.

Students at Canadian universities not covered by the WDA may still be eligible
to enroll under the terms of the Canadian University Graduate Transfer
Agreement (CUGTA) of the [Canadian Association for Graduate
Studies (CAGS)](https://cags.ca/). The details of this program vary by university,
please contact your local Graduate Student Advisor for more information.
